# ItemPickupPlus
A Fabric Minecraft mod that makes it more challenging (and annoying) to mine within deepslate.

### Installation
Requires Minecraft 1.20.1, [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) >=0.14.25, [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).\
Optionally requires [JsonPatcher](https://modrinth.com/mod/jsonpatcher) to have the new mob included into kill_a_mob and kill_all_mobs advancements.

### Configuration
The mod can be configured from within the file ".minecraft/config/deepslateinfestation.json5" or using modmenu.
* Light level preventing Deepslate Silverfish spawning can be specified (15 by default, meaning allow spawning regardless of light level)
* Maximum height below which to allow Deepslate Silverfish spawning can be specified (0 by default, meaning allow spawning where deepslate starts generating)
